ðŸ“ŒHow this Script works :
User just need to download the file and run the main.py on their local system.
On the starting window of the application, user will be able to see START and EXIT option, using which user can start the application or exit from the application.

ðŸ“ŒPurrpose :
This scripts helps user to easily get the count of human through real time image, video or camera, and thereafter also analysis of crowd through crowd report.

ðŸ“ŒCompilation Steps :
Install all the required libraries.
After that download the code file, and run main.py on local system.
Then the script will start running and user can explore it by detecting the human and also getting the count of it.
